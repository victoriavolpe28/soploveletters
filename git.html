<ul>
<li><h2>Since you work closely with <i><sub>(Bash)</i></sub> you know that it just isn't right to keep secretly seeing each other.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>But when I look at you or think of you I can't stay away. 
You just <i><sub>(git)</i></sub> me.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>I remember when you saw me there in the lobby, <i><sub>(git init)</i></sub> you initialized the start of us, and all our possible directories completely from scratch with a glimpse of an eye. </h2></li>
 <li><h2><i><sub>(git add.)</i><sub>you confessed your feelings and said you wanted to commit solely to me, and you wanted to make sure our files were up to date with this new information.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>So you need to <i><sub>(git status)</i></sub> to be updated on how we stand and our status to add a new file together.</h2></li>
 <li><h2><i><sub>(git diff)</i></sub>you show me the difference between you both. You're in the repo branch and he's in the working branch.</h2></li>
<li><h2>But I have to <i><sub>(git rm)</i></sub> and make myself remove you from repo like a file. </h2></li>
<li><h2>Don't think that I will <i><sub>(add filename)</i></sub> and track you down like a lost file.</h1></li>
 <li><h2><i><sub>(git mv "fileold' 'filenew')</i></sub>I need to rename our whole relationship and file, as over and done. </h2></li>
 <li><h2><i><sub>(git commit-m)</i></sub> i know you are going to try to save us and everything like a scrapbook or photo album, but don't.</h1></li>
 <li><h2>I know when i look back and press <i><sub>(git log)</i></sub> I will see all the beautiful and fun times we had together too and I'll smile.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>But our lives just can't <i><sub>(git merge)</i></sub> like branches combining changes into one.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>You need to get it in your head that no matter how much we love each other we can never be.</h2></li>
<li><h2>I'm sorry. I love you. We just can't be for now.</li></h2>
<li><h2>To one day our paths crossing again.</li><h2>
<li><h2>Good bye my love.</li></h2>
